# Scrabble Scorer

Unofficial website for computing players' scores in Scrabble

### Instructions

- During their turn, the player should choose a cell on the board for the starting point of their word. Then they should specify if the word is in the horizontal or vertical direction.

- In case a blank tile is played, the \_ character should be used in the program.

- The website automatically computes the score of their turn. If multiple words are played in one turn, the total score is displayed. The breakdown of these words could be seen through the **View Moves** button.

### Features

- **Undo** - If a mistake is made such as the word is placed incorrectly, the turn could be reversed with the Undo button. It is symbolized by the left arrow below the screen.

- **Challenge** - It uses [dictionaryapi](https://dictionaryapi.dev/) to check if a word exists by providing the part of speech and definition of a word.

Thanks for playing!
